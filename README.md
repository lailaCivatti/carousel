This is an image carousel

Here are some of the things I want it to do:

1. Have a nice transition between images
2. Have arrow icons to allow user to scroll through
3. Make it auto rotate every few seconds
4. Link it to a better UI alternative, because carousels are terrible for conversion and UX ^^'
