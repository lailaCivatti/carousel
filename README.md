# This is an image carousel

Here are some of the things I want to do with it:

1. Make it accessible:
    Colors need more contrast
    Does it work with just the keyboard?
2. Have a call to action on each card, maybe pretending to be a travel website?
3. Or allow for file upload?
4. Use a library to activate swipe motion on mobile devices

No auto-play, it's bad for UX.
