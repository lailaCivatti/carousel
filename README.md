This is an image carousel

Here are some of the things I want it to do:

1. Represent photos as cards
2. Have a nice transition between cards
3. Have arrow icons to allow user to scroll through, that only show when image is hovered and are completely opaque only when clicked maybe
4. Have a progress widget, dots are the standard

No auto-play, it's bad for UX.
